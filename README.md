# RUNE

This is _still_ work in progress...

## Idea

For quite some time now I wanted to make a virtual machine that is register based
and have the same freedom as forth. How will I achieve this? I don't know. Inspired
by UXN machine, I developed this. I removed an entire stack and turned it into registers.
It will still have the return stack, and my machine will have silly opcodes that will be
mapped to characters, like '+' will be the opcode for ADD. I think it will be a
fun challenge to try to manually write some programs by hand.

- The name RUNE came from this idea of characters as opcodes.
- I like to think about programers being wizards, casting spells and refining magic.
- Let's build some games and a fantasy console with this?
- Just don't forget to have fun. (note for myself)
