# Glyph

## Idea

For quite some time now I wanted to make a virtual machine.
One that is register based and have the same freedom as forth.
How will I achieve this? I don't know.
Inspired by [UXN](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html).
I removed an stack and turned it into registers.
It will still have the return stack and I want it to have silly opcodes.
Opcodes that are characters, like `+` being the opcode for ADD.
I think it will be a fun challenge to manually write some programs by hand.

- The name Glyph came from this idea of characters as opcodes.
- I like to think about programers being wizards.
 - casting spells and refining magic.
- Maybe build some games and a fantasy console with this?
- Just don't forget to have fun. (note for myself)
